# The Internet's Impact on How Couples Meet

This project analyzes how internet adoption changed relationship formation patterns, inspired by Cisco's origin story where founders Sandy Lerner and Leonard Bosak created early networking solutions to communicate while dating.

## Key Analysis

✅ **Multi-line graph** showing trends in meeting methods over time  
✅ **Comparative horizontal bar plots** for selected decades  
✅ **Subplot visualization** contrasting two different decades  

## Project Extensions Completed

1. **Decade-Specific Breakdown**  
   - Created horizontal bar plot showing meeting method distributions for the 2010s

2. **Cross-Decade Comparison**  
   - Developed subplots comparing:
     - Pre-internet era (e.g., 1980s)  
     - Digital dating era (e.g., 2010s)  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas (data cleaning/analysis)  
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (visualizations)  

## How to Run
```bash
jupyter notebook internet_dating_analysis.ipynb
